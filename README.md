  Gatsby's hello-world starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this hello-world boilerplate for sourcing MDX from DFRNT via GraphQL, that you can then  adapt to your needs. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running fast with the blazing fast app generator for React when building static websites out of your DFRNT data products.

Ensure you have the Blogpost type (and all prerequisites) from the DFRNT Schema Library implemented, then copy/paste the contents of blogpost.json into a new record of "Blogpost" type in your instance at [DFRNT.com](https://dfrnt.com). Create your `.env.development` file with your DFRNT API token, and edit the URL to the GraphQL endpoint for your data product (using the free trial version):

* `https://dfrnt.com/api/hosted/:instance/graphql/:instance/:dataproductname`

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying this mdx-remote-hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the mdx-remote-hello-world starter
    gatsby new my-gatsby-starter-dfrnt-graphql https://github.com/dfrnt-com/gatsby-starter-dfrnt-graphql
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-gatsby-starter-dfrnt-graphql/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).

    Open the `my-mdx-remote-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

    The remote MDX is represented with using the `@dfrnt/gatsby-source-grapql-nodes` commented out in `gatsby-config.ts` and the corresponding section in `sourceNodes` of `gatsby-node.ts` is also commented out in favor of just starting with programmatically creating the corresponding MDX for a self-contained MDX example.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a typical Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

1.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

1.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
